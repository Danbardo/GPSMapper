# GPSMapper
 A simple application of the Google Maps API to construct paths and generate the associated co-ordinates.

This was developed to generate co-ordinate sets for a navigation application I was working on several years ago. I couldn't find anything online that did this, so I thought I'd share it here.

I was hoping to further develop this so that I could incorporate nodes and customisable weightings but I haven't had the time.
